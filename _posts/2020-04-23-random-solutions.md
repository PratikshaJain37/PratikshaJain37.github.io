Alvin Toffler once said "The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn."

This repository is dedicated to my quest for knowledge, and being able to learn new techniques (and their application). 

A lot of my earlier scripts used naive approaches, and I hope I can keep evolving to better ones.

### Aim: ### 
To learn new algorithms, and implement them in both C++ and Python

### Progress: ### 
<ul> 
<li> Solving questions from CodeChef and CodeForces </li>
<li> Learnt Greedy Algorithm </li>
<li> Learnt Binary Exponentiation </li>
</ul>
